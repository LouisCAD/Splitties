# Splitties

Splitties is a collection of small Kotlin multiplatform libraries (with Android as first target).

These libraries are intended to reduce the amount of code you have to write, freeing code reading and writing
time, so you can focus more on what you want to build for your users (even if you're the only one), or
have more time to have `fun`.

This project is named "Splitties" because it is split in small modules,
distributed as independent libraries, so you can add only the ones
you need to your project/module, helping reduce the size of the final binary that users devices
will need to download and keep in the limited storage (BTW, everything is limited).

Some Android targeting modules have a content similar to what [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko) offers.
See [a short comparison of Splitties with Anko here](Comparison_with_anko.md).

Each module has been designed to have a **small footprint** and be as **efficient** as possible.

## A few examples

Splitties is all about simplifying your code. Here are a few examples:

**Kotlin:**
```kotlin
startActivity(Intent(this, DemoActivity::class.java))
```

**Kotlin with Splitties [Activities](modules/activities):**
```kotlin
start<DemoActivity>()
```

----

**Kotlin:**
```kotlin
Snackbar.make(root, R.string.refresh_successful, Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT)
    .show()
```

**Kotlin with Splitties [Snackbar](modules/snackbar):**
```kotlin
root.snack(R.string.refresh_successful)
```
----

**Racing coroutines:** (`raceOf(…)` comes from [the Coroutines module](modules/coroutines))

```kotlin
suspend fun awaitUserChoice(ui: SomeUi, choices: List<Stuff>): Stuff? = raceOf({
    ui.awaitSomeUserAction(choices)
}, {
    ui.awaitDismissal()
    null
}, {
    ui.showSomethingInRealtimeUntilCancelled() // Returns Nothing, will run, but never "win".
})
```

----

**Kotlin:**
```kotlin
Snackbar.make(root, getString(R.string.deleted_x_items, deletedCount), Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
    .setAction(android.R.string.cancel) {
        deleteOperation.requestRollback()
    }
    .setActionTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.fancy_color))
    .show()
```

**Kotlin with Splitties [Snackbar](modules/snackbar):**
```kotlin
root.longSnack(str(R.string.deleted_x_items, deletedCount)) {
    action(android.R.string.cancel, textColor = color(R.color.fancy_color)) {
        deleteOperation.requestRollback()
    }
}
```

### Gradle instructions

Make sure you have `mavenCentral()` in the repositories defined in your project's
(root) `build.gradle` file (default for new Android Studio projects).

To make it easier to take advantage of the contents of Splitties for your Android projects, there
are grouping artifacts that include _most_ splits.

#### All the artifacts (47)

Since you might use multiple artifacts, to not repeat yourself, we recommend you to put the version in a central place,
so it's little effort to upgrade to newer versions.

The best way to do this is to use [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions),
it has built-in dependency notations for `Splitties`, and also many other popular and qualitative libraries,
like kotlinx, AndroidX, libraries from Square/CashApp and libraries from Google.

Most importantly, with it, running the `refreshVersions` task will show you the available updates in a matter of seconds,
for all of your dependencies, right into the `versions.properties`, in a way that makes upgrading effortless,
even with just the keyboard.

FYI, the current latest release of Splitties is the version `3.0.0-rc03`

#### Snapshots

Let's say you need to try a new feature or a fix that did not make it to a release yet:

You can grab it in the snapshot version by adding the corresponding repository as shown below, and
changing the library version to the latest snapshot, `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`:

```groovy
allProjects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        google() // Add sonatype snapshots repo below
        maven(url = "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots")
    }
}
```

## New versions notifications

Releases are announced on GitHub, you can subscribe by [clicking on "Watch", then "Releases only"](
https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository
).

However, if you use [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions),
you'll also learn about updates when you run the `refreshVersions` task right in the `versions.properties` file.

## Improve this library

If you want this library to have **a new feature or an improvement** in a
new or in an existing module, please, open an issue or vote/comment a
similar one first, so it can be discussed.

**Documentation contributions** are also welcome.
For typos or other small improvements, feel free to submit a PR
(pull request) directly.
For more significant doc contributions, please open an issue first, so it
can be discussed.

**If you find a bug**, please open an issue with all the important details.
If you know a simple fix that is not API breaking and that does not have
side effects that need to be considered, you may also directly submit a PR.

You can also join the discussion on Kotlin's Slack in the
[#splitties](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/messages/splitties) channel (you can get an invitation
[here](http://slack.kotlinlang.org/)).

## What is a split

A "split" is a module of the Splitties library that you can add as a
dependency. It only includes the required transitive dependencies.
This allows you to only add what you need in your app or library module,
so the final apk/ipa/app is as small as possible and doesn't include stuff not used
by your app.

Let's say you're building a Wear OS app using the Views DSL.
Wear OS apps don't need AppCompat. Including it would be a waste of
bandwidth and storage. The Views DSL core module relies on the Android
SDK but not on AppCompat, so you don't bloat your wrist app with AppCompat
by using Views DSL. However, if you are building a phone, tablet or computer
Android app, there's a Views DSL AppCompat split with a few extensions for
you to use.

Special thanks to [Jovche Mitrejchevski](https://twitter.com/jovchem) for
helping in taking decisions for this project.

Thanks to JetBrains and the contributors for [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko),
which was a great source of inspiration, especially for Views DSL, and of course
thanks for the excellent [Kotlin](https://kotl.in) programming language that makes this project possible.

["Kotlin & Android: A Brass Tacks Experiment"](
https://medium.com/@CodingDoug/kotlin-android-a-brass-tacks-experiment-part-3-84e65d567a37
). It is fair to say that Views DSL has its root in this experiment.
