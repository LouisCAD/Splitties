/**
 * Returns immediately if the [permissions] are all already granted or if the device API level is
 * lower than 23 (runtime permissions were introduced in API level 23, and are granted at
 * app installation time on older Android API levels).
 *
 * In the [showRationaleAndContinueOrReturn] function, you should show the rationale for the
 * permission you are requesting, await for user acknowledgement, and return `true` if the user
 * agreed to continue. If you return `false` in that function, the [returnOrThrowBlock] function
 * will be executed and the permission won't be requested again.
 *
 * The [showRationaleBeforeFirstAsk] parameter is true by default. If the context in which the
 * permission is asked makes it absolutely obvious why it is required, then you should set it to
 * `false`. Such an example is asking for camera permission when the user pressed a button to start
 * recording a video.
 *
 * The [askOpenSettingsOrReturn] function is executed if the user ticked the "do not ask again"
 * checkbox and denied the permission. You can show a relevant message to the user if needed and
 * await for an interaction before returning a value. If you return `true`, the application details
 * will be opened in the device settings, and the user will be able to enable the permissions.
 * When the user comes back into your app, this function (`ensurePermission`) will return
 * immediately if the permission that was asked has been granted. Otherwise, the function will
 * show the rationale again (calling [showRationaleAndContinueOrReturn]), restarting the permission
 * request process. If you return `false`, the [returnOrThrowBlock] function will be executed and
 * the permission won't be requested again.
 *
 * The [returnOrThrowBlock] function is inline (like all the other functions you pass here), so if
 * you put a `return` expression in it, the function at call site will return. Note that the type
 * of a `return` expression is always [Nothing], regardless of the type of what is returned.
 * You can also throw if that better suits the way you handle the user cancelling the permission
 * grant.
 *
 * The passed [ComponentActivity] is used for 3 things:
 *
 * 1. To check whether we should show the rationale for the permission
 * request, and is also used in the case we need to open the application details settings to let the
 * user grant the permission in case the do not ask again checkbox was ticked.
 *
 * 2. To get a [Lifecycle] that will be used to await the resumed state before requesting the
 * permission, and will also be used to await user coming back from application details settings
 * if that path was required.
 *
 * 3. To get the [ActivityResultRegistry] that allows performing the permission request, and get
 * the result.
