# Arch Room

*Room helpers to instantiate your DB and perform transactions in Kotlin.*

Supported platforms: **Android**.

## Setup

This dependency is not included in any of the [fun-packs](../../README.md#download),
because many apps don't need Room, either because they use [SqlDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) or another database system,
or because they don't need a database at all.

Add it with [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions):
`Splitties.archRoom`.

For reference, the maven coordinates of this module are `com.louiscad.splitties:splitties-arch-room`.

## Content

### Room Database instantiation

The `roomDb(â€¦)` function has a reified type parameter used to call
`Room.databaseBuilder` with the proper arguments. `name` is the only
required parameter.

You can specify a `Context` as first parameter if you don't want to use the
application context, if you want to use a different context (e.g. to use
`directBootCtx` in a direct boot aware app component).

The last parameter is a lambda with the db builder as receiver where you
can things like migrations.
