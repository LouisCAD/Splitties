# Selectable Views ConstraintLayout

*[Selectable Views](../views-selectable) for ConstraintLayout.*

Supported platforms: **Android**.

## Setup

If you want to use this dependency without using one of the [fun packs](../../README.md#download),
you can use `Splitties.viewsSelectableConstraintlayout`, provided you have [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions) added to the project.

For reference, the maven coordinates of this module are `com.louiscad.splitties:splitties-views-selectable-constraintlayout`.

## Usage

Just use `SelectableConstraintLayout` with the proper import instead of
`ConstraintLayout`, and change the `foregroundSelector` `Drawable` if the
default doesn't suit your needs.
