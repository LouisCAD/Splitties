# Material Colors

*[2014 Material Design color palettes](
https://material.io/design/color/#tools-for-picking-colors
) as color resources.*

Supported platforms: **Android**.

## Setup

If you want to use this dependency without using one of the [fun packs](../../README.md#download),
you can use `Splitties.materialColors`, provided you have [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions) added to the project.

For reference, the maven coordinates of this module are `com.louiscad.splitties:splitties-material-colors`.

## Content

This split contains color resources for all the colors referenced in the
Material Design guidelines before 2018 change (which added a material palette
generator).

### Examples:

* Red 500: `R.color.red_500` / `@color/red_500`
* Cyan accent 400: `R.color.cyan_a400` / `@color/cyan_a400`
