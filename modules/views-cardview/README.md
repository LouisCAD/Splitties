# Views CardView

*CardView extension of [Views](../views)*

Supported platforms: **Android**.

## Setup

If you want to use this dependency without using one of the [fun packs](../../README.md#download),
you can use `Splitties.viewsCardview`, provided you have [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions) added to the project.

For reference, the maven coordinates of this module are `com.louiscad.splitties:splitties-views-cardview`.

## Content

`contentPadding` allows to set the padding of the content of a `CardView`
using property syntax.

This is all this split provides at the moment.
