 * the contrary.
 *
 * Let's say you want to throw an [IllegalStateException] for a custom condition, it's [readChecker]
 * responsibility to do it. [check] or [require] from stdlib may help you implement this kind
 * of check.
 *
 * This lazy is as safe as the [readChecker] is: an empty one will be like calling [kotlin.lazy] with
 * [kotlin.LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE], which is potentially unsafe.
