# Bit Flags

*`hasFlag`, `withFlag` and `minusFlag` extensions on `Long`, `Int`, `Short`
and `Byte`*

These extensions make dealing with bit flags easier.
 
These small inline extensions can be proven handy since bit flags are found in
multiple places over the Android API, in low level stuff when you
have to deal with raw bytes, and maybe in your own codebase too.
